Agency Project
Hello, this is one of the three projects named Agency Project. In this project, I attempted to run the program offline using the codes I obtained from Codelessley. I separated the navigation bar and facilitated transitions between screens. I moved the icons and images, at least for the homepage, to a folder and accessed them offline. However, I believe there might be an issue with the codes, possibly related to the 'positioned' property, which has prevented the program from running. I started trying other solutions.

File Locations:
Pages: You can find the code for the pages in:

bash
Copy code
agency/lib/Screens/pages
Widgets: You'll see the widgets used on the pages in:

bash
Copy code
agency/lib/Screens/widgets
GlobalWidget (Navigation Bar): The code for the navbar can be found at:

bash
Copy code
agency/lib/Screens/widgets/globalWidget
I tried my best to structure the project in a way that new functions can be easily added.


 
Agency_C1 Project
Hello, this is one of the three projects, titled Agency_C1. In this project, I attempted to run it online by transferring the layout IDs using the codes I obtained from Codelessly and its SDK. I successfully managed to operate it online; however, transitioning to an offline mode proved challenging, and I couldn't achieve it. As a result, the project remains in its current online state.

Important References:
SDK in pubspec.yaml: You can find the SDK details in the pubspec.yaml file.
SDK Token in main: Check the main folder to see how the SDK token is utilized.
If you're interested, I can grant access through Codelessly. Please inform me if you'd like to proceed.


Last File Project
Hello, this is one of the three projects named Last File. In this project, I utilized the DhiWhise tool. I've done my best to structure it in a way that allows for easy addition of functions. 
You can access the files in three different structures: Bloc, Getx, and Without State.
